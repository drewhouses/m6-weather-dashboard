Need to take in city string and parse it into query string
query string will be used to request info from weather API
Before passing city to query string, it will have to be passed
to geocoding API in order to get coordinates
WHen passing coordinates I need to get current day weather and 
next 5 day forecast
Need to structure and display weahter info in a readable intuitive way

input string will also have to be stored in localStorage and
saved visually on the webpage in a history section.
When the past cities strings are clicked on, it will once again display
that city's weather


A loop can create a button for each of the previously entered cities
